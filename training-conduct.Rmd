# Conducting the Training

This chapter provides details on how to deliver an effective and efficient interviewer training that facilitates learning without overstretching survey resources. The chapter assumes in-person training as is the case for most surveys conducted with in person interviews. The first subchapter covers general training considerations. The following chapters are organised by training module, provide details on the rational, optimal timing and good ways of conducting each respective module. See the field plan on how modules relate and when to deliver them.

Before you start, make sure the training is fully set up LINK PREPARATION.

## General considerations

In general, consider the following points for the training.  

- __Eliminate language barriers__. Train in the language trainees are fluent in. Don’t force them to speak your language if they do not fully understand it. If you don’t speak the local language, either work with an interpreter, or have your local colleagues reiterate your points in the local language, e.g. the fieldwork managers.  

- __Support__. Especially during the first few days, trainees often get lost in the CAPI or questionnaire and are unable to follow the sessions. Trainers not actively leading a session can walk around the class, check that trainees are in the right place and support those falling behind.  

- __Probe for understanding__. It is wrong to assume things have been understood if you just ask “Any questions?” and there are none. There hardly ever are any. Probe using common examples or scenarios. Ask variations of your test questions. For example, think of working profiles/jobs that are typical in the surveyed population and probe trainees if these are wage employed or self-employed.   

- __Encourage questions__. Often trainees do not dare to ask if they have questions. Make it clear to trainees from the beginning that asking questions is much better than not knowing something during the tests and that they should ask if they have any doubt. During sessions, they can raise their hand and be visited by a trainer. 

- __Involve trainees__. Asking frequent questions. Let trainees read aloud questions and manuals. Ask them to correct one another. Don’t always pick the most engaged trainees but try to involve everyone. Select a trainee using a random name picker such as https://wheelofnames.com, so it can be anybody’s turn to answer your questions at any moment. They make it fun if displayed in front of class. Alternatively, select the person that is closest to where the paper ball lands. Select one trainee for a couple of questions to speed up things. 

- __Collect feedback__. At the end of the day, use feedback forms to collect anonymous feedback from trainees on how clear different sessions or trainers were, topics they did not understand or questions they have. Review feedback forms prior to the next day and adjust your training schedule or methods if needed.   

- __Break up and mix seating arrangements__. If you start noticing groups of trainees sitting together who are not paying attention or are in the bottom end of performance, distribute them across the classroom. Ask low performers to sit next to high performers, so they can help when falling behind. 

- __Essentials only__. Only train interviewers on things that are relevant for them and that they are required to do. For example, there is no need for them to learn details about the analysis or experimental design. Likewise, if only supervisors collect GPS coordinates, this is better trained only to them.   

- __Confirm with designers/analysts__. For solid results, the interpretation of a question must be aligned all the way from how it has been conceptualized to how it is fielded. This is not always the case. Note anything you are uncertain about or is underdefined and run it by designers/analysts on a daily basis. Ask them to be on standby so you receive timely responses.  

- __Make it fun__! Let the last person entering the venue late and unexcused sing a song in front of the class to help with punctuality (Youtube is full of Karaoke videos). Play fun and exciting group games like Protect the egg or let trainees get to know each other in ice breakers. 

- __Use video & audio__. Some things are best demonstrated to interviewers, so they can see/hear what should and should not be done and learn from examples. Examples can be introduction to household, take anthropocentric measures, or other practical or non-scripted tasks. Use existing material, or collect video/audio material during pre-test, pilots and field practices to demonstrate good and bad practices to the class. 

- __Control the group__. Set rules on talking use of mobile phones, punctuality and enforce them. 

- __Ask if you don't know.__ Keep notes of any scenarios that you do not know how to interpret and run them by relevant experts or decision makers in the evening. Provide feedback to the class once you have received the answer (ideally the following day).

 If theTrainers should compile  survey designers are not present, questions need to be compiled, sent to them and answered quickly, so feedback can be given the following day.

Trainees should attend all training days and must catch up in other ways if it has been inevitable to miss one session or day.  

## Opening module

speaches, importace, introduction big shots, try to keep short as much as political

introduction of team, sure, can roatate, but people will not get to know ech other, will do in group practices and lunch etc. instead a short ice breaker 

 At the beginning, introduce the survey, sketch out the training and field work plan and set the training rules. Keep it short so you can focus on content during this day. 

Introduction to organization, the survey, the project/study, etc. Do not go into too much detail here and limit it to the essential. Interviewers do not need to know about the details of the analysis plan or the full history of surveys in the country. You can provide more details in the manual and refer trainees to it. 

Training and field work plan. Run through the training plan, where to be when, when the selection will take place and where and when field work will take place. Importantly, this should be a refresher, NOT be the first time trainees learn details about their pay, other terms or the field work. Make sure all trainees have understood and signed a copy of the general terms prior to the training. 

Ask trainees to write their name on a name tag and carry it during the training. You have little time to learn who is who and being able to connect names with faces helps to get an overview quicker.  

Set training rules. You can also print/write them on a poster. Examples: 

- __Be on time__. Trainees must be on time in the morning and after breaks. Trainers should respect the schedule and not run over time. Late comers in the morning or after breaks could sing a song in front of class or donate to the cookie jar.  

- __No phones, no side activities__. Trainees must pay attention and should not use their phones or have unnecessary side conversations. Phone users could donate to the cookie jar or you could collect a phone and keep them until the end of the day if used repeatedly.  

- __Trainees are responsible for their learning__. Trainees can read the manual, practice outside the class, learn from peers etc to make sure they understand everything. It is no problem - and is actually encouraged - to ask questions during or after the training, but it will be a problem to not understand something and not say anything. There is a transparent selection process and they must pass it. 

- __Zero tolerance for cheating__. This is a high quality survey that collects valid data. Anybody being caught making up data or purposefully breaking protocols will be immediately dismissed. There is nothing to fear as long as one follows what has been taught during training and communicates special cases to the survey management. 


MICS: 

The opening day should be kept light, but also set the stage for the task ahead:
-	All trainers and members of the survey management should be introduced.
-	One or more high level officials should be invited to give opening speeches.
-	Each participant should introduce themselves (keep it short).
-	The survey should be introduced along with key concepts and norms for the training and the agenda.
-	Trainees should be briefed on all logistical arrangements and payments, so that they are not distracted by these details during the training.

## CAPI use 

You can train the questionnaire directly in CAPI if you are using Survey Solutions or another CAPI software that  

1. provides a good overview over the questionnaire,  

1. makes routing behavior clearly understandable and  

1. allows for free navigation. 

This has the advantage that trainees do not need to learn how to navigate in CAPI the questionnaire they learned in a different format. They only learn it in the format they will use in the field, and will practice CAPI along the way, making them much earlier confident in using it.  

Train CAPI just before trainees need to use it for the first time. If you are training the questionnaire on CAPI, introduce the CAPI software just before the questionnaire reading starts. If you are training the questionnaire on paper, train CAPI just before trainees practice for the first time on the tablets. 

This chapter is written keeping Survey Solutions in mind, but the same principles apply to other packages. 

CAPI, as any other software, is best learned by using it. Covering lots of functionality in an extensive theoretical session tends to be very ineffective as functionality that is not immediately put to practice is forgotten and needs to be retrained. It is more productive and a better use of time to initially only train the functionality that is necessary to proceed with the training, and to introduce additional functionality as required throughout the training. For example, trainees only need to learn how rejected interviews work once they need to deal with it in the latter part of the training.  

Limit the functionality you train to what is relevant from the perspective of an interviewer and what will be used in the actual survey. Trainees do not need to learn details about the supervisor interface or central server. 

The fewer slides you have in the CAPI training and the more demo and practice you do the better. Train CAPI functionality by demonstrating it on the big screen and asking trainees to follow on their own device. Make sure the class can follow and wait for those falling behind to catch up. Those lost should check with their neighbors or raise their hand, so one of the trainers can come to assist. 

If training the questionnaire directly in Survey Solutions, train on the following in the initial introduction to CAPI: 

- A general overview, interviewer server, assignments, files, marking as complete, synchronizing to the server. Keep this part short.  
- How to log-in to the Interviewer app. Make sure tablets and accounts have been set up prior to the training. How to create an interview file from their assignment.  

- The general overview of the application and how to navigate through the questionnaire.  

- The outline of a question, the question number, the question text (what to read and what not), the instructions, the answer options (different by type). 

- Question enablement. It is sufficient to work on the first section of the questionnaire.  

- The complete screen, marking an interview as complete. 

- The started and completed screen on the dashboard, reopening an interview file, discarding an interview file. 

Having completed the above steps, trainees should be set-up to follow the questionnaire during the questionnaire reading sessions.  

The remaining functionality is best trained throughout the training on an as needed basis. Train: 

- Different question types and roster forms during the questionnaire reading sessions, e.g. list questions in the household member module, yes/no questions in assets, etc. Trainees need to recognize and understand the difference between single select, multi-select, numeric, list and date questions, and understand the rosters. 

- How to synchronize to receive assignments, create new interview files, review interviews on the complete screen, marking them as complete and synchronize to send a file. If you are conducting the tests LINK on Survey Solutions, a good moment to train this is just prior to the first test, as interviewers will have to synchronize to get the assignment and submit their test. 

- How to add comments in the CAPI should be reviewed prior to group practice or practicing in the field, so that trainees can leave questions and comments directly in the questionnaire when practicing.  

- How to receive rejected interviews, respond to comments, etc after the field test or the dress rehearsal, so trainees can practice it directly in interviews they have created. See details LINK TO SECTION.  

## Questionnaire content 

During the training, all questionnaires must be read and discussed in full, including all related definitions and concepts. Questionnaire reading sessions can be extremely dry and a waste of time if implemented badly. Follow below points to ensure the sessions are fruitful:

- Allow for enough time. Do not underestimate the required time. Some survey firms, especially when coming from opinion surveys, only allocate a few hours for a single quick read of the questionnaire. This is not sufficient for complex socio-economic surveys where interviewers need to understand a wide range of concepts, definitions, and scenarios to correctly administer the questionnaire.  
- Avoid long blocks of questionnaire reading. They are an information overload and make it impossible for trainees to internalize the content. Spread the questionnaire reading over several days and let trainees regularly practice the newly learned material in between.    

- Apply the theory. Definitions for survey concepts such as “household”, “wage employed”, “self-employed”, “parcel”, etc. are very theoretical and hard for trainees to translate into the real world. Illustrate them with examples and scenarios to make them tangible for trainees. 

- Keep the content together. Explain concepts and key definitions as they come up in the questionnaire, so trainees immediately learn how to apply them to the questionnaire and can easily remember them. Covering all definitions and concepts up front is abstract and out of context.      

- Avoid chalk and talk, i.e. trainers speaking or presenting in front of the class without much interaction. Involve the trainees as much as possible for example by making the questionnaire reading a conversation. Select a trainee to read aloud the question, answer options and the manual entry. Ask them to explain in their own words what they have understood. Correct them if needed. Ask the rest of the class for input. Probe the trainee with an example or scenario.  

- Train using the Interviewer Manual (LINK). You must get trainees used to consult the manual to get additional information or to clarify doubts, or the manual will never be used. Ask trainees to keep the manual open on paper or as softcopy on their device. After reading each question, ask trainees to check if there is a corresponding manual and read it. Assign one of the trainers to update the manual directly during the training if the entry is unclear or insufficient. Ask for input from the class if needed and confirm with them if the update is clear. Distribute updated soft copies of the manual to the team every morning/evening.  

- Use your time effectively. There will always be a few rare cases in the population that the questionnaire does not cover well. Trainees love pointing those out, e.g. “But what if ….?” Get a feeling if these are frequent enough that they require you to update the questionnaire. If not, tell trainees to leave comments in the questionnaire if the situation arises in the field, and move on with the training, so that you have enough time to focus on the important concepts. If longer discussions arise on a certain point, clarify and stop the discussion. If you are not sure how to answer, get back to them the next day after having read up or consulted with the design team.  

- Train the questionnaire directly in CAPI without training on paper first, if you use Survey Solutions or another CAPI software that provides a good overview of the questionnaire, makes routing behavior clearly understandable for interviewers and allows for free navigation (Do NOT do this with software that displays one question per screen). Training first on paper requires trainees to learn the instrument in two formats and often delays trainees becoming confident with the CAPI version. By training directly in CAPI, trainees only learn the questionnaire in the interface used in the field and learn from the beginning how to use and navigate it. It also reduces the material that needs to be covered.

- If the questionnaire is administered in other languages than the training language, display the questionnaire in the training language and ask interviewers to look at it in the translated local languages. For each question, ask it to be read in the training and local languages. This serves to verify the translation and to familiarize trainees with the questionnaire in the local language. Update the translations if anything needs correction. Ask the class for inputs or a dedicated person to help if there are many issues slowing down the training.  

As trainees read questions loud, as a mini role play to mimic the interviewer-respondent interaction. Check for their interviewer intonation way of asking tone of voice etc. Give feedback and ask interviewers to repeat until correct. 

MICS: "Training sessions for each module should start with an overall short introduction to the module topic conveying why the topic is of importance. This introduction can be done by the topical expert who needs to be instructed to be concise. The session should then proceed by a detailed description of each question with instructions on how to administer the question and follow the skip patterns. This session is done by MICS trainer, who will use examples to illustrate flow of interview. When appropriate, sessions must address established ethical protocols, ranging from how to handle private information or specifically how to deal with respondents volunteering information on unlawful behaviour either by themselves or others, or protocol when observation or measurement reveal critical conditions. 

Every session should end with time allocated for questions and answers.
"

- Unfortunately, due to budget and time constraints, often changes have been implmented to the questionnaire or processes between pre-test and training that have not been field tested  when there are still changes to the instruments or  were introduced pre-testing was rushed or no full-scale pilot conducted prior. The training makes . In those circumstances, interviewer training also effectively serves as a field test of methodology. Crucial to reduce of specification error.

## Practicing

Trainees should frequently practice learnt material in the form of group practicing, with respondents on-site or in the field. Different practice forms are not mutually exclusive. They fulfill different purposes and should occur at different stages of the training.

mini role plays, 

### Group practice 

Frequent group practice sessions are important for trainees to familiarize themselves with the questionnaire, practice the use of CAPI, learn from peers, and to break-up the monotony of questionnaire training. 

Hold group exercise every day after new theoretical content has been introduced, so trainees can put it to practice and internalize it better. On days that are theory heavy, such as the questionnaire reading days, do not wait until the end of the day or until the questionnaire has been covered fully. Instead hold 2 or 3 practice sessions per day at natural breaks (e.g. between sections) to practice the material/sections covered just prior. The change of training modality helps to maintain attention levels. Immediately repeating material helps trainees to understand and internalize it and to uncover any questions. Practicing more frequently becomes infeasible as each practice requires time to set–up.   

Group exercise can be effective for pairs of trainees or small groups of 3-8 trainees. Change group composition between exercises. When allocating trainees to groups, mix trainees and break up clusters that formed in the class, so that low/high performers and those paying more/less attention are distributed. Try to be efficient and not to waste time when creating groups. For pairs, ask trainees to practice with their peers in the row in front/behind. For groups, work out the number of groups n needed, and repeatedly count loud from 1 to n, pointing at a trainee for each number. Each number corresponds to a group, and each number/group can meet in a different point of the training venue, e.g. “All number 4s, meet at the blackboard”. 

Ask groups to practice the questionnaire sections that have been covered since the last practicing session. If there is time, groups can also practice all sections learned to date. They should not work through parts of the questionnaire that have not been covered yet.    

Give scenarios for trainees to ensure they practice scenarios that are likely to occur in the local context and cover all parts of the questionnaire. For example, when practicing the labor section, ask to complete it for an employed individual, self-employed, supporting family worker, etc. 

Within each group, one trainee should read and ask the questions while another one answers them. After a few questions/sections the roles should be rotated, so each trainee had the opportunity to act as an interviewer or respondent. All trainees in a group should follow on their own tablet and record the answers, which at the end should be identical for all trainees within a group in theory. Ask groups to submit their interviews after the feedback session to motivate them to get it correct. 

Feedback after practicing sessions tends to be thin. Asking the class if there were any doubts, questions or comments often results in general silence. In order to receive better feedback, ask groups to actively come up with feedback points, note them on a sheet of paper including the trainees’ names, and to submit those to the trainers at the end of the exercise. Feedback points can be any question or doubt they have about questionnaire, definitions, scenarios, etc or any mistakes they have found. You can set a minimum number of feedback points, e.g. 3 during the beginning of the training when things are not clear yet, and 1 towards the end of the training.  

Trainers should observe groups that have been allocated to them, correct mistakes and help struggling trainees on the spot, but also take note of the issues they observed for the feedback session. They should consider any issues, including the way questions were read or answered, the intonation, misunderstandings, questionnaire navigation, CAPI use etc. While observing, trainers should also record trainees' skill levels (see Chapter SKILLS) and give individual feedback where necessary. 

Debrief with the entire class immediately after the exercise. Ask groups for their written feedback and discuss and answer their questions in class involving input from other teams/trainees. Ask trainers to provide the feedback from their observations, explaining what was done wrongly and also how to do it correctly. Ask trainees who have been observed to do something well to demonstrate to the class (e.g. how to explain a concept/question), so that all can learn from good examples.

### On-site respondents  

While group practicing is a good way to get trainees familiarized with the instrument, the scenarios and concepts remain hypothetical and theoretical until trainees learn to apply them with actual respondents. The first exposure to the real-world often is during field testing, which can have some logistical downsides: It is time consuming to move trainees to the field and allocate them to respondents willing to participate. Also it is impossible for trainers to observe more than a handful of trainees who are scattered across many homes.  

Practicing with real respondents on-site is a great way to give trainees more and early exposure to field conditions, and for trainers to observe all trainees conducting interviews. 

The best timing for an on-site practice is after the questionnaire has been covered completely and be practiced in group practicing, and prior to the first field test.  

Hire a group of respondents to visit the training venue or some other convenient location to be interviewed there. Depending on the number of trainees, some 5-10 respondents are usually enough. They should be similar to respondents in the surveyed population, e.g. cultivate land and keep livestock in agricultural surveys, or have jobs or small businesses in labor force surveys. Make sure to compensate respondents adequately, pay for the transport and refreshments or to invite them to the training lunch should it be provided. 

For the practicing, group trainees into as many groups as you have respondents, ideally not more then 4-6 interviewers per respondent. Each group should conduct a full interview with the respondent. Each trainee should follow on their own device and record answers, and they should take turns in asking the questions, e.g. a few questions or a section at a time. Groups should support each other if individuals fall behind, have questions or make mistakes. Ask groups to submit their interviews after the feedback session to motivate them to get it correct.  

If there is sufficient time, groups can switch respondents and conduct a second or third interview.  

Collect feedback, observe and debrief as described above in Chapter GROUP PRACTICE.

### Field practice 

The purpose of field practice is for trainees to get first experience in implementing the questionnaire with real respondents. There is no need to completely mimic field conditions as one does in dress rehearsals. Rather, aim to maximize the number of interviews each trainee can conduct and the number of respondents and scenarios they are exposed to. Prepare them well, observe trainees and collect good feedback to make them a success.  

Field practice sessions should be held after the questionnaire has been trained and practiced in class, and before the final dress rehearsal at the end of the training. Often it also makes sense to conduct it prior to sessions on household tracking, receiving rejecting interviews, logistics etc, so that content is broken down more and the field test can focus on the understanding and implementation of the questionnaire only. If the questionnaire is really long, e.g. a LSMS-ISA style questionnaire with long household and agricultural questionnaires, you probably want to conduct more frequent field practices for different parts.  

Field practice often is implemented inefficiently with a lot of time being spent on logistics that could have been prepared in advance: Teams wait for transport, for community introduction, look for respondents, etc. It is not uncommon that a whole day is spent for trainees to conduct one 1 hour interview in the field or that trainees could not practice as they did not find respondents. Prepare well, so trainees can practice interviewing, not waiting.  

Visit communities that are not too far from the training venue and large enough to have enough respondents for all trainees. Communities should have similar characteristics to the surveyed communities, but be outside of the sample. Contact or visit the communities the day prior to the field practice, do the community introduction and arrange for respondents at the time of your expected arrival, e.g. with the help of a community leader. Compensating respondents for their participation often helps with their availability and willingness to participate and is totally fine during field practicing. Again, the aim is for trainees to practice the questionnaire as much as possible with respondents. 

Try to minimize other logistical issues that could cause delays. Make sure all tablets are fully charged, synchronized and have battery packs available if needed. Arrange for food and drinks for trainees in the field or ask them to bring it. Make sure your transport arrives on time, knows the way and does not need to stop for petrol. Try to arrive early in communities, as respondents tend to become unavailable during lunch hours. 

Group trainees in pairs of 2, trying to take skill levels into account and pairing high with low performers. Allocate each pair with a respondent. Agree on a meeting place for trainees to return to and a time by when they need to be back latest. Ideally, there is time for more than one interview per pair.  

Similar to the on-site group practices, trainees should take turns interviewing the respondent and both record all answers and submit the interview file at the end of the day. Ask them to write down any issues they experience while they conduct the interview. Working in pairs, one of them can take notes while the other one is interviewing. For each interview, each pair should list at least one question or doubt they had, and something about their interview or respondent that was noteworthy and is useful to share with the class.  

Try to observe as many of the pairs as possible, help and correct where necessary, mark their skills (LINK), and note down any issues you have observed as general feedback for the class. Focus on trainees that are borderline of being selected or that have not been marked yet.  

Collect as much feedback as possible from trainees __before__ you leave the community. It becomes much harder later and the quality of the feedback decreases rapidly. As pairs of trainees arrive back at the meeting place, ask for their written notes, debrief quickly with each pair, clarify any issues they had, and record general feedback for the class. 

:::: { .warning  data-latex=""}
Often trainers assume that the questionnaire is working well and that interviewers are able to administer it correctly because they did not report any issues during feedback sessions. This assumption is wrong. Many issues cannot be identified by interviewers, are forgotten or not reported. Those reported are biased towards trainee’s concerns, e.g. they are quick to report something that caused extra effort from their side. Trainers must observe interviews being conducted and compile their own feedback. To receive meaningful feedback from trainees, trainees must note down issues or questions as they experience them and must be debriefed shortly after conducting interviews.
::::

After each field test, hold a general debrief session with the entire class in which you respond to the written feedback from the team, answer any questions, and provide feedback from your observations. This might involve short retraining of concepts or questions that have been ill understood, practicing or role plays. Clarify all issues prior to the next field test. It is normal for quite a few things to go wrong in the first field test and to improve quickly.   

Sometimes, you can debrief to some extent directly in the field in an empty classroom, a community center, the shadow of a big tree, etc. This way interviews are still fresh in everyone's head and there is no need to go back to the classroom after the transport back from the field. If you are required to debrief the same day in the classroom, make sure to leave the field in time and to allow for a long break, as everyone tends to be really tired after field practicing, especially after the transport back.  

Design your training schedule such that field practicing days are followed by classroom days, so you can have a detailed debrief session in the classroom with the big screen and other all required facilities.  



## Interviewing techniques 

In addition to understanding the questionnaire content, interviewers must master a range of interviewing techniques that are crucial to collect good quality data. Some examples are:  

- __Introduction and interview request__: Being able to convince respondents to participate in the survey is key to keep unit non-response error low, particularly in urban areas or other settings with high refusal rates.

- __Interview continuation__: Being able to keep respondents engaged in lengthy interviews and stop them from prematurely ending the interview is important to minimize item non-response and measurement error.

- __Inquiring__: Respondents often do not understand or misinterpret a question, give incomplete answers, respond *"I don't know"* or do not want to disclose some information. Interviewers need to be able to get respondents to answer all questions in a neutral and non-leading manner. 

- __Controlling interviews__: Respondents sometimes digress, give lengthy explanations, or talk about other things. Interviewers need to be able to lead the conversation in a pleasant and courteous manner to maintain the respondent's cooperation. 

Unfortunately, these interviewing techniques are rarely trained. Instead it is assumed that interviewers automatically know them or will learn them over the course of the survey. In reality, while some interviewers are experienced or naturally good at it, many others struggle or resort to undesirable practices such as making wrong promises to obtain consent or leading responses. This can exacerbate interviewer effects and lead to high levels of measurement error and unit and item non-response. Teaching trainees that are not good a task the skills of those that are mitigates these effects, e.g. see @Groves2001.

Teaching interviewing techniques goes beyond theory. All features of communication are relevant for the interaction between interviewers and respondents, including the choice of words, tone of voice, volume, as well as attitude, facial expressions or gestures. To learn a technique, trainees have to see and hear what they should and shouldn't do, and learn from good examples. To be able to put techniques into use, trainees need to repeatedly practice and receive feedback until they are able to (re)act correctly and quickly.. 

Which interviewing techniques are best trained depend on the survey. Interviewers can face different challenges in the field. For example, refusals may be rare in a household survey, but very frequent in a enterprise survey, requiring dedicated training on how to address them. In addition, best practices often are sensitive to the culture and context, e.g. how to inquire if respondents are hesitant to disclose their income. Therefore, the training agenda on interviewing techniques usually needs to be tailored to each survey.

### Identify challenges and responses

To establish which interviewing techniques are most relevant for the survey and should be trained, first compile a list of the key challenges that interviewers are expected to face in the field and need to be prepared for. Focus on those that are most common and have the biggest effect on survey error. Consider any response, concern or action by the respondent or any other situation that can negatively affect data quality if interviewers do not apply the right technique. Examples are:

- respondents refusing an interview stating reasons related to time, etc.
- other members trying to listen to sections to be administered in privacy
- respondents unable to quantify consumption amounts in units
- long and damaging breaks if tablet needs to be restarted
- error messages flagging gross mismatch in harvest quantities, land size and sale prices

Record different ways in which a challenge may manifest itself or how the interviewer can recognize them in the field, using colloquial terms or used by respondents where it applies. As an example, respondents may say *"I am really busy "*, *"I need to leave"* or *"I need to cook/wash/..."* when refusing and stating reasons related to time.

For each challenge, identify good interviewer responses. These can include verbal responses actions or procedures. Often, there is no single response to a challenge that works equally well with all respondents and in all circumstances. Good interviewers often have a repertoire of responses and tailor them to observable features of the respondent or the context. For example, if a respondent refused based on time and appears to be rushed or pre-occupied about something (e.g. fighting children) the best response tends to be to ask for a different moment, e.g. by saying *"I see that now is difficult. When would be a good moment for me to come back?"*. However, if the respondent refuses because they have to do a chore but seems generally collaborative, it is often good to offer to do the interview while they do their activity. 

For each challenge, also record bad practices or responses that interviewers should avoid, if there are any. As an example, if respondents do not know the quantity consumed of an item, a bad probing practice would be say *"Was it maybe 1 kg?"*, as this is leading the respondent to answer 1 KG. 

Allocate challenges and responses into separate modules by topic, importance and anticipated time required to train. It is usually good to have at least one module on *Introduction and interview request*, one on *Inquiring and controlling interview* and one on *Challenges observed during field testing*. You might need additional modules on key questions or sections, such as *Estimating land size* or *Conducting consumption module*. 

Ideally, challenges and responses should be compiled prior to the training to facilitate planning and make training sessions more productive. Use a combination of any of the following sources to identify challenges and responses:

- experience from previous surveys with similar context, populations and subject
- focus groups with experienced interviewers
- observations and feedback from pre-test or pilots

If you are unable to prepare prior to the training, use challenges and responses observed during field practice sessions or hold short "focus groups" with the class at the beginning of each module. 

See HERE be a core set of challenges and responses that are common to many surveys. && NOTE: WOULD IT MAKE SENSE TO COMPILE ONE?

### Train & Practice

Schedule modules on interviewing techniques just prior to field practice and final field tests so trainees can apply the techniques soon after. Additionally, you might need to schedule some modules after field practice and field test to practice new situations that came up during field practice or retrain those that do not yet work well. Module between 45 min and 1.5 hrs tend to be sufficient to cover one core topic. 

For each module, first train interviewers on what challenges are likely to occur and what the best response are. Project the list of challenges, categories and good responses on the big screen. Work through each category, identifying together with the class the ways in which challenges may manifest themselves and any tips and tricks for a good response. Also cover bad practices that interviewers should avoid. Ask trainees that are good at a technique (experienced or good inter-personal skills) to demonstrate the best practices in front of class in a role play. Give feedback if necessary and ask the class for input to get consensus and make sure responses are appropriate for culture and context. Try to keep this part short.

After having covered the theory, drill trainees until they are able to respond to a challenge quickly, correctly and in a natural manner. This is best done by asking trainees to simulate the interviewer-respondent interaction in front of class in a role play, providing immediate feedback and letting them repeat if necessary. Depending on class size and skill level, it might be best to divide the class into large groups, each supervised by a trainer. 

To practice, select one trainee to act as interviewer and if needed another one to act as respondent. Usually, it is more useful for the trainer to act as respondent as it allows them to better drive the conversation. Ask the selected trainee to come to the front or just stand up and speak towards the class, which is often faster. Explain the scenario and challenge and ask the trainee to re-enact the interviewer response as if it was a real field situation, speaking loudly so the entire class can hear. Give feedback on what they have done well and what not. Ask the class for inputs. If the response could be improved, ask the trainee to repeat the response. Collect feedback, correct them and ask them to repeat until the trainee does it well. Practice with as many trainees as possible or until the response generally works well. This can be quite a lot of fun and is a good way of breaking longer theoretical sessions.  

Two examples to illustrate: 

To practice introduction to the survey, select one trainee, ask them to stand up, tell them that they just knocked at a door, a certain type of person opened, that they should introduce themselves and ask for participation. Check that they are giving all necessary information, say nothing wrong, are easy to understand, use the right tone of voice, have good facial expressions and gestures, etc. Collect feedback from the class. Ask the trainee to repeat their introduction until it is correct in content and well presented.

To practice asking for participation, ask a selected trainee to make an introduction and ask for participation as above. Act as respondent who is unwilling to participate, stating one of the challenges discussed in the training, such as such as _“I am really busy now”_ or _“What do I get out of this?”_. Ask the trainee to respond and convince you to participate. Again, together with the class, check if the trainee's response was quick, correct and natural. Give feedback on possible improvements and let the trainee repeat their response until satisfactory.   

## Special tasks 

For some surveys interviewers need to learn a special task that requires repeated and structured practice until they can perform it correctly and on auto pilot. As a trainer, you need to identify trainees who are struggling with the task and be aware of scenarios that cause issues. Examples for special tasks are:  

- Plot size measurement 
- Anthropometry 
- Collecting samples, e.g. to measure water quality 
- Extracting information from registries, records, etc. 
- Behavioral games 

Typically, these tasks require interviewers to strictly implement a protocol, use additional tools or aids or understand differently structured documents. Explaining the theory and going through one example is not enough. You need to practice in a structured way and evaluate trainees, exposing them to different scenarios if necessary. The best way of doing this depends on the task at hand.  

One option is to run through scenarios together so all trainees practice the same thing at the same time. For example, if interviewers need to record details from school time tables, display a picture of an actual timetable from a school on the big screen, and ask trainees to record the required information on their tablets. Run through examples of different time table formats, so interviewers get used to different scenarios. Walk through the class and identify any trainees who are struggling. Provide feedback and discuss in the wider class if there is any confusion. If interviewers need to perform a task on automatic pilot, for example, operate testing equipment, ask the class to repeat it over and over until everyone can perform it correctly all the time.  

Another option is to set up workstations that interviewers need to go through. Set up different scenarios in or around the venue and staff some with trainers if necessary. Trainees go from station to station and complete the respective task. At the end, each trainee should have undergone the same scenarios and a general debrief can be held. Trainers can observe each trainee at their respective station, evaluate and provide personal feedback. Set up stations such that interviewers spend their time practicing, not queuing. Examples for workstations can be plots with different shapes and cultivation, trainers playing common scenarios in behavioral games, or different documents that need to be evaluated. 

### Specialized teams 

If a task is very complicated, requires special background knowledge or if there is not enough time to train it well to all interviewers during the training, field work model permitting, it is often best to specialize some fieldworkers to exclusively conduct the task and distribute them across the field teams. Examples where this tends to be useful are: 

- Anthropometrics, especially when taking all measures, i.e. weight, height/length and middle upper arm circumference (MUAC)   

- Learning outcome assessments used in school surveys that include reading, writing and math tests with strict administration protocols.   

- Medical tests, such as taking blood pressure or measuring hemoglobin values. This often requires the use of specialized equipment and trained nurses. 

Training any of those tasks can take several days. For example, learning outcome assessments require trainees to handle test booklets, CAPI and a timer all at once while keeping a young child engaged. It usually takes days to practice until all trainees can conduct the assessment tests in a homogenos way, and not everyone is good at it. 

Train selected trainees in separate sessions in parallel to the interviewer training. Practice all components of the task, including the equipment use, measurement reading, and interaction with the respondent. Invite practicing respondents to the training venue to practice the human component and create closer to field conditions. For more details, see section Inhouse respondents.  

For anthropometrics, the components that need to be practiced include the correct setup of scales and height/length boards, taking the measurements, how to treat the children/babies, reading the measurements (careful, some are dislexic), and recording them. At the beginning, the measurements taken for the same person differ quite a bit between trainees. Practice until they converge after a few days.

## Responding to inquiries 

In some surveys, interviewers receive feedback or inquiries about interviews they have submitted that require them to take some action or respond. In Survey Solutions, this is done using rejected interview files. This often goes wrong in surveys and needs to be covered in the training if implemented in the field. There is a big risk that interviewers “fix” interviews by simply changing answers to make issues go away, without actually addressing the underlying problem. Interviewers need to understand what they must and must not do. Train and practice in a dedicated session towards the end of the training. 

Ideally, trainees can practice with actual examples from interview files they have produced themselves. This makes it less theoretical and shows trainees that they made mistakes and what they were. You can use interview files from the field test (LINK) or even better, the final dress rehearsal (LINK), as interviews will generally be of better quality. This implies that the session needs to be held towards the very end of the survey.  

Prior to the session, carefully review submitted interviews and identify any issues. Normally,  at the beginning there tends to be at least one per interview, make up some if there are none. Write comments and feedback as would be written during field work and reject the interviews to the interviewer. Try to do this with at least one file per trainee/pair. 

During the session, first give a quick general introduction to explain the rejected files tab on the interviewer dashboard, how to open a rejected file, how to read the rejection comment, how to see all comments by the supervisor, how to react to rejected files, respond to comments and resubmit them by marking them as complete and synchronizing.  

Then, project a rejected interview to the main screen and ask the respective trainee/pair to come to the front. They should explain what led to their mistake and what they should do if this occurred in the field. Ask them to respond to the issues and resubmit the file on screen. Ask the class to help and comment. Repeat this with as many files/trainees as possible and useful. Ask all trainees who did not solve their file on the big screen to solve it on their tablet and resubmit them. 

This exercise is also a great way to identify and streamline the rules around responding to rejected files, revisiting respondents, etc. For more information see chapter REJECTING FILES.

## Final field test (often called pilot) 

In a dress rehearsal all survey questionnaires and protocols are tested under real-field conditions prior to field work. It is an important exercise to:  

- Expose interviewers to real conditions and give them the opportunity to practice without affecting the sample 

- Determine if the field team is ready for field work 

- Identify and address any outstanding issues with questionnaire or field procedures  

Some surveys do not conduct a separate pilot prior to the training (link chapter PILOT) and refer to the dress rehearsal as pilot. In those cases, the dress rehearsal importantly serves as a final reality check for questionnaires and protocols, since they have not been tested in full in field conditions before. 

The dress rehearsal should be conducted at the end of the training and prior to the field work. Usually, 2-3 days of dress rehearsal are sufficient. If short debriefing/feedback sessions can be held in the late afternoon of each day, they can be on sequential days. If not, schedule debriefing/feedback days between field days. Allow for at least one class room day after the dress rehearsal for an extensive feedback session and to teach the class on how to deal with rejected files / inquiries from HQ. Additionally, you might need to allow for additional time for admin, rest days or travel to the field location.  

To create as close conditions to the field as possible, the dress rehearsal must be conducted with units that are similar to those in the survey sample, but crucially that are not part of the sample. For household surveys, this usually means conducting the dress rehearsal in un-selected communities within the survey areas and often requires the team to travel from the training location closer to the field. For surveys part of RCTs, this means practicing within the treatment arms. 

Ideally, locate the dress rehearsal such that the entire field team can be supervised and debriefed together in a central location. This ensures that all field workers have received the same inputs and reduces team effect. Split the dress rehearsal into different locations if there is a large variability in the sample that affects questionnaires or protocols. If doing so, try to streamline as much as possible the supervision and feedback given to all groups, e.g. by trainers exchanging notes before providing feedback to their respective group. 

Often it is easiest to select a set of units (e.g. communities) for the dress rehearsal during the sample design and have them undergo the same preparation steps as the sampled units, e.g. assignment of IDs, procurement of reference data, add them to the CAPI questionnaire, do community sensitisation, etc. For surveys with a separate listing exercise or panel surveys, conduct the dress rehearsal for all stages using the same units and keep the data, so you can properly prepare and test each stage of the survey. It can be very laborious and cumbersome to prepare separate data.   

One important aspect of dress rehearsal is for field workers to practice the selection, identification and tracking of survey units such as households, convincing respondents to participate and to learn how to make appointments and to manage time. Do not pre-arrange respondents as one would do during field practice. Equip interviewers with the same assignments or tracking sheet format they would receive during field work. If you do not have lists or names for the rehearsal units (e.g. you have the household names for sampled communities, but not for practicing communities), send someone to the community before  the dress rehearsal to compile lists that you can use to produce the assignments/tracking lists.

Allocate interviewers to their expected field teams and let the supervisors assume their management role, including the assignment of cases to interviewers. For the dress rehearsal, often it is beneficial for interviewers to conduct interviews in pairs. This reduces the number of cases required in any of the visited communities, increases the probability of finding available respondents and allows interviewers to help one another. Each pair can conduct multiple interviews per day and take turns in administering the questionnaire. As in the field tests, both interviewers should record all answers in their own tablet and submit the interview in the end.  

For the dress rehearsal you might need to relax replacement protocols and add additional replacement units, so interviewers can practice conducting some interviews even if non–response is high. 

Make sure field teams arrive early in the communities, so that interviewers have enough time to locate cases and conduct interviews before respondents start cooking/having lunch and become unavailable. As for the field practice, make all necessary logistical arrangements to prevent delays or hungry/thirsty field workers in the field.  

Collect feedback and debrief as described in chapter FIELD PRACTICE. Ask all interviewers to submit their interviews at the end of the day. Use the data to finalize your data system (link DATA SYSTEM) and quality control system, e.g. by updating the data checks. Review submitted interviews using the standard processes of the quality control system. In addition, visually review as many cases as possible and compile feedback for interviewers and the quality assurance team.  

The data collected during dress rehearsal is a great way to learn and practice receiving feedback with the team, see chapter feedback.
