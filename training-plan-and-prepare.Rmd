# Planning and Preparing

## Training Content

To equip trainees with all the knowledge and skills necessary to do a successful job as interviewers, training must go beyond a simple discussion of the questionnaire and cover the following components:

- CAPI: Try to focus on the interviewer perspective and limit it to the functionality that is relevant for the interviewer in this study. Keep the theory to a limit and practice as much as possible. It is better to gradually introduce new functionality as needed rather than have an extensive theoretical session at the beginning.

- Questionnaire. Question types, questionnaire formatting, navigation, routing, understand all questions and answer options. How to administer each question and section. Underlying key concepts and definitions.

 Practicing. Repeated practicing, alone, in groups and with respondents is required, so that interviewers are fully familiar with the questionnaire content, know how to navigate it in the CAPI tool, can administer it correctly and get exposure to real respondents and scenarios during the training.
 
- Protocols. Exercises such as capacity tests, anthropometrics, plot measurement or behavioral games require strict adherence to protocols for comparable measurements. Trainees must fully internalize protocols and practice them until behavior across the entire field team has been homogenized.

- Assignment management. How to receive household assignments. How to find and locate households. When and how often to revisit. Replacement protocols. How to plan interviews and manage your workload.

- Interviewing skills. How to introduce yourself and the study as well as convince respondents to participate. How (not) to ask questions. How to not lead questions. How to probe, inquire, get clarifications. How to control the interview. Manage respondents time. How to deal with impatient respondents.

- Post-interview skills. How to check for completion. How to address in-consistencies. How to leave comments. How and when to submit files. How to receive feedback and respond to inquiries on submitted interviews. How to (not) make corrections. How to ask questions.

- A full dress rehearsal at the end of the training that mimics real field conditions and asks interviewers to track and interview households. 


## Duration & Schedule 

The best timing for field worker training is just prior to the start of field work, as interviewers still remember the trained material and can solidify it by practicing it immediately in the field. The more time passes, the more interviewers develop idiosyncratic behavior, driving the interviewer effect. Usually, you need to cater for 1-3 days between training and field work to allow for admin, give a rest day to the team and for them to travel to the field. Should fieldwork be delayed beyond a few days after training, a short refresher training just prior to the field start is useful to refresh trained material. If the field start is being delayed further, a longer refresher training or complete retraining will be necessary. 

Schedule at least 1 full week (6 days) of interviewer training per 1-1.5 hr questionnaire time. To some readers, this might sound long, and many survey firms, especially when conducting opinion surveys will suggest much shorter training times. In most cases it is impossible to train the field teams to a higher standard in a shorter amount of time. Do not save on training days, unless you are very confident that you all trainees will have fully internalized the required material and be able to perform well as field workers.  

Socio-economic questionnaires are long and complex. They require interviews to understand a large number of questions  and to fully internalize complex concepts and definitions such as employment types, or land management systems, etc., and to correctly apply those in the field. On top of that, interviewers need to learn and practice a range of skills such as convincing respondents to participate or continue, troubleshooting inconsistencies, responding to feedback from supervisors, etc.    

In many surveys, trainees are not ready to go to the field at the end of the training and the training needs to be extended last minute. If extensions have not been budgeted for, firms will have to cut corners elsewhere to compensate for increased costs. Avoid this by setting out with a realistic training duration and putting contingencies for potential extensions into the budget and timelines. 

Prepare a solid schedule and try to stick to it during the training. Track your progress on an on-going basis and make adjustments as early as possible if you are falling behind.  

A few consideration for drawing up a functional training schedule: 

1. Do not exceed 6-7 hours of training session per day and give frequent breaks without the breaks taking over the day. For example, a morning session from 8.30 AM - 12 PM, and an afternoon session from 1 PM - 5 PM, each with a flexible 15 minutes break. 

1. Frequently change training modality, e.g. by putting practicing sessions between questionnaire reading sessions. Avoid as much as possible long sessions of only questionnaire content, PowerPoint, theory only. 

1. Trainee attention levels tend to be lower after lunch and in the afternoon. During these times,  schedule hands-on, more interactive sessions that require greater engagement from trainees, such as practicing or quizzes. 

1. Be efficient. Only train content that interviewers need to know. Allocate time on topics proportionate to the direct importance for the interviewers. 

1. Keep it together. Train material only in context, once it is needed and can be practiced. Example, practice “How to introduce and ask for participation” the day before the first field practice or agricultural key definitions when going through the respective questionnaire. 

1. Stay flexible. You could draw up a very detailed plan with exact timings for each session, but in reality the timing of sessions tends to shift a bit during the training. Use the schedule as guidance to track progress, but stay flexible to allow sufficient time to address issues, retrain topics, or dive into more detail as needed. 

1. Allocate time generously. It is better to finish training early one day rather than keeping trainees until late, being behind schedule or rushing content. If you are falling behind schedule during the training, extend the training as early as possible so all logistical arrangements can be adjusted. 

1. Specialize fieldworkers. If your survey requires a lot of different questionnaires (e.g. in school surveys) or special tasks to be conducted (e.g. medical samples), it is often too much material for all interviewers to learn everything. Instead, divide the field teams into different roles that each completes a different set of questionnaires/tasks. During the training, those questionnaires/tasks can be trained in parallel sessions, allowing for more in-depth training. 

1. Train field supervisors data monitors or similar roles outside of the hours of the interviewer training, so they can attend the interviewer training in full and know everything interviewers are supposed to (not) do. Typical time slots are towards the end of the training once supervisors have been selected during the late afternoon or evenings, or during administrative days or rest days.    

1. Schedule classroom days after field days so that you can hold in-class debrief sessions with the big screen.  

Below is an example training and piloting schedule for a 1hr-long questionnaire collecting information on agriculture and a few other socio-economic indicators. The schedule allows for practicing of learned material, changes modality frequently, and includes daily quizzes and feedback sessions.

```{r training_schedule, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)

schedule <- read_xlsx("resources/training_schedule.xlsx")

schedule %>%
  kbl(align = "cll") %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T)
```

You can download the sample schedule as an Excel from [here](resources/training_schedule.xlsx).

## Material 

Come prepared. Try to prep training materials as much as possible to have more time to focus on training. 

Questionnaires. often not sufficiently tested, not clear. Make sure they have been tested. 

Quiz

## Trainees

To ensure that all field workers possess the skills and level of understanding required to collect quality data, it is crucial to train more staff than are needed, which allows for competency-based selection of field workers at the end of the training. See more in Chapter xxx. For a meaningful selection process, train at least 20% more fieldworkers than are required if most of the trainees are experienced and have already worked on very similar surveys, or up to 40% more than required if most are new recruits or have not worked on similarly complex surveys.    

Often, some trainees will drop out during the training, particularly after day 1 or 2 once there is a clearer understanding of the required tasks. Mitigate the attrition by keeping some of the applicants that have not been invited to the training on standby, so they can quickly replace trainees that have not come back. You might have to bring them up to speed in extra hours and ask them to independently learn already covered material to quickly come up to speed. Alternatively, you can also start with a higher excess of trainees. 

Learning outcomes quickly decrease as training size increases. If possible, try to keep training size below 50-60 trainees (equivalent to 30-50 field workers), by adjusting the fieldwork plan, so that fewer interviewers work over a longer period of time. See chapter XXX on other benefits for a smaller team.  

If more than 60 trainees need to be trained, make sure to have additional trainers and break into smaller group sessions where possible. Whenever trainees are separated into groups, put extra effort into preparing the training materials, so all groups receive the same inputs. Also set up a functioning feedback cycle, so that all trainees benefit from relevant feedback, comments, questions, etc raised in one group and that any updates are communicated to all trainees. The same applies for repeated training, or training split otherwise, e.g. regional training.    

Trainees should attend all training days and must catch up in other ways if it has been inevitable to miss one session or day.  

Especially when working with unknown teams of trainees, it is beneficial to not determine roles up-front, but to select trainees into field worker roles (interviewer, supervisor, etc) based on their skills and knowledge. Long term supervisors sometimes develop a sense of entitlement or superiority, don’t pay attention as much and as a result don’t know the material as much as interviewers. Sometimes they also don’t hold their position due to other factors. See more on sections FIELD WORKERS and SELECTION.   

Beware of experienced trainees coming from other surveys. Standards might have been lower in their previous training and they may have developed some undesirable habits that you need to untrain. Also, they might have a stronger sense of “I already know that” and engage less. Most surveys are significantly different for even experienced interviewers to learn the concepts and protocols.

**WARNING!**

In some surveys, there have been walk-outs of trainees, often towards the end of the training, in which trainees collectively refuse to continue the training or to work as field workers unless their demands are met. Usually, there is no time or budget to repeat the training with other trainees, leaving survey management in a very weak bargaining position and putting the survey itself at risk. Avoid walk-outs by setting fair terms and conditions (see details in Section…) and explaining them in detail to trainees prior to the training. Ask trainees to sign a copy of the terms prior to the training.

## Trainers 

Conducting a field worker training well is a substantial amount of work. Apart from leading a training session, there are hundreds of other things that need to happen in parallel, such as updating the questionnaire, translation, CAPI, manual, preparing training sessions or quizzes, compiling feedback, marking quizzes, scoring trainees, observing exercises, etc. The trainer workload can be reduced substantially by having thoroughly vetted instruments [LINK TO INSTRUMENTS] and being prepared well for training [LINK TO CHAPTER PREP]. Even so, having too few trainers will hasten their burn out and almost certainly data quality will suffer as a result.  

Make sure to provide enough trainers and that they have the capacity and time to engage. For a training with 50 trainees you need at least 2 trainers that can engage full time. If trainers need to do other tasks outside of the training (which is usually the case), cater for more trainers, so that you have at least 2 who are engaged at any point in time. Avoid the situation where trainers are physically present at the table in front of the venue, but stare into their laptops without following the training. 

The group of trainers should comprise the following capacities: 

1. Comprehensive and solid understanding of the instruments, definitions and protocols 

1. A good understanding of the indicators construction, the intended data use or analysis.  Ideally trainers have been involved in the survey design process. During the training, decisions often need to be made or feedback given about how to treat certain scenarios. Those decisions need to be analytically correct. If survey designers are not present, questions need to be compiled, sent to them and answered quickly, so feedback can be given the following day. 

1. Experience in implementing the relevant survey type 

1. Experience in implementing surveys in the country and have a good understanding of the country context 

1. Experience in implementing interviewer training 

1. Speak the training language. Do not make trainers (or trainees) speak a language they are not fluent in. If some trainers (usually survey designers or analysts) do not speak the training language, translate for them. 

Make sure the group of trainers collectively have the above capacities. There is a tendency to send junior analysts or PhD students without sufficient survey experience to conduct the interviewer training of a survey. This can work, as long as other experienced trainers are present, but quickly leads to quality issues if they are the main training lead.  

Similarly, handing over a sample and questionnaire to a survey firm and letting them implement the training without close engagement is usually a bad idea. Firms commonly lack the analytical background, do not know about the details of the survey design, are differently motivated, and might not have the capacity to conduct the training to the required standard. If you are the main survey stake holder and are working with a new firm, be present, engage and ensure the training meets quality standards described here.   

Apart from the technical tasks, there usually is a significant amount of logistical arrangements to be made during a training, ranging from organizing refreshments or transport, setting up tablets, fixing internet, printing, finding respondents, organizing contracts etc. Expect this to take up a good amount of time of the field work manager. Depending on the context, you might need an additional logistical support staff that takes on some of those tasks and ensures a smooth implementation of the training.  

## Logistics

Training time is precious, yet often it is wasted with logistical issues that could have been addressed in advance. Prepare the venue and logistics prior to the training to allow for a smooth training without delays. 

For the trainees: 

- Make sure they have learned about the survey details and terms before the training, including the areas to be visited, the population to be interviewed, the transport and lodging arrangements during field work, the length of field work, the interviewer selection process, their remuneration package, insurance, contract details etc. Provide them in written form and have each trainee sign it prior to the training. 

- Schedule any contract signing for a time or day that does not interfere with the training. Pulling trainees in and out during a session reduces its effectiveness.  

For the training venue: 

- Find a venue with a big hall large enough to fit the entire team and space to breakout into smaller teams for group exercises, such as a garden, hallway, cantine and additional rooms.    

- You will need a projector with a BIG screen. Make sure it is visible to all trainees and that you can project different tablets onto the big screen without any delays. Test the set-up prior to the start of the training. 

- Stable internet connection for all tablets. Trainees have to sync their tablets several times per day. Usually, the WIFI connection of the training venue is not sufficient to connect all 60-70 tablets at the same time. Often, additional mobile network routers or WIFI hotspots are required. One option is to already provide the internet connection that is planned for field work, e.g. the dongles, mobile phone routers or sim cards with data packages. Make sure not to choose a training venue without internet connection or with scarce network coverage.  

- Electricity and extension cords to charge all devices.  

- White board and markers for drawings 

- Microphones (if needed) 

- Arrangement for food and refreshments for the breaks. If food is provided, make sure it is ready in time for the break. If trainees eat out, set reasonable break times that allow trainees to be back in time. Incentivise punctuality, e.g. the last one to come back from break has to sing a song.  

- Sticker for the name tags for trainees. 

### For CAPI surveys: 

- One device for each trainee. It is crucial for trainees to learn how to navigate the questionnaire and use the device. If you do not have enough devices (since there are more trainees than interviewers) borrow devices or use the private devices of the trainees.  

- Devices must meet the minimum specifications for the software (see here for Survey Solutions). 

- If coordinates need to be recorded, the devices has to have a GPS chip 

- The correct version of the CAPI software installed, with a shortcut/icon on the main screen 

- A soft copy of the manual with a shortcut on the main screen. You can also provide a printed hard copy of the manual, but bear in mind that the manual might be updated during the training 

- A shortcut to the calculator on the main screen 

- You may or may not want to lock other applications of the device using app lockers.  

- The CAPI software is fully set up. For Survey Solutions, this includes: 

- Installation of Survey Solutions on a server 

- Interviewer accounts for each trainee 

- The questionnaire imported 

- Assignments made to each interviewer account. For training, often an open assignment with an infinite quantity (-1) is useful.  

- If the questionnaire relies on more substantially prefilling (i.e. beyond basic information to locate the household/individual), then create several assignments with different scenarios for the prefilling. 

### For on-site or in-field practicing:  

- Organize reliable transport options and make sure they arrive on time, so the team does not need to wait. 

- Select practice areas/villages well in advance. Make all necessary administrative arrangements like getting permissions, introduction to village officials, etc.  

[ ] Arrange respondents for field practicing, so trainees can spend more time practicing than looking for respondents to participate   

- [ ] For on-site practicing, arrange for respondents to visit the training venue, including the transport, food/refreshment and remuneration.
