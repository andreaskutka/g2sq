Few survey components affect data quality more than fieldwork training. Yet, unfortunately in many surveys, fieldworker training is neglected, under budgeted or implemented so poorly that there is little learning happening. No field work monitoring tool or exercise can fix a training that has failed to produce fieldworkers who are fully capable of accurately implementing the survey.   
This chapter describes how a successful interviewer training can be conducted. If you only have a few minutes, read the key points in subsection 1(LINK). If you are looking for more detail, read the relevant subchapters before you get to this point in the training preparation or delivery. 

## tl;dr Key Recommendations

This tl;dr is for readers who want to see our “cheatsheet” version of the chapters on training. If you are looking for more details, we think you’ll benefit from reading the rest of the chapters. Follow below key points to ensure a successful interviewer training. 

1. __Train an excess of 20-40% of field workers__ and select them based on skills at the end of the training, even if working with experienced teams. Trainees take the training more seriously, pay attention, and learn and the overall skill level of field workers is higher.  

1. __Continuously evaluate__ trainee performance and capacity in written tests, role plays, questions in class and observing them while practicing. 

1. __Don’t cut on duration__! Allow for at least one full week of training per 1.5 hours questionnaire length. Anything less is normally not enough for the content to be learned and practiced.  

1. __Keep it small__. Try not to train more than 50 persons at a time, so you get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the trainees. Adjust field work to take longer to allow a smaller field work team.  

1. __Fewer one-directional presentations, more interaction__. Avoid long sessions of information being rained in on trainees. Make the training interactive and frequently change the training modality.  

1. __Practice__. Frequent practicing is crucial for trainees to fully internalize and be able to apply what they have learned. Practice in house and in the field.   

1. __Be prepared__. Have questionnaires, manuals and tests ready prior to the start of the training, the venue fully set up and all admin and logistics sorted.  

1. __Focus__. Only teach what interviewers need to know to do their work well. Spend more time on things that are crucial to the survey. Instead of giving a 2hr presentation on the analysis of the data, give a short introduction and practice with interviewers how to introduce the study in the field.  

1. __Enough trainers__. Delivering good training is more than a full time job. Many things need to happen in parallel to the training being delivered. More trainers are better, and best if stakeholders, designers and analysts are among them. 

1. __Engage__. As a survey designer, do not do your emails on the side table and leave it to the survey firm, fieldwork manager or trainers alone to deliver the training. Actively participate, check that the content is correctly understood, explain what matters, etc. You have put a lot of effort into the design. Make sure it is implemented correctly.
