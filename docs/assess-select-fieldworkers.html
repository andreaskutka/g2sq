<p>LSMS highly recommends to train an <a href="planning-and-preparation.html#trainingsize">excess of fieldworkers</a>, continuously evaluate trainee performance throughout the training and to select interviewers, supervisors and other fieldwork roles at the end of the training, based on skills and capacity. This chapter gives step-by-step guides on how to implement this process. A competitive skill-based fieldworker selection serves several functions that are critical to achieve quality in the survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>ultimate means to get to know interviewers so you can select them. last stage of interviewer recruitment process. Past survey experience, CVs and interview often not enough during recruitment process to identify those that are good at being interviewers form those that are not. Motivation, etc can only be observed over a sustained amount of time. Selection rpoecess should be at the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially when working with unknown teams of trainees, it is beneficial to not determine roles up-front, but to select trainees into field worker roles (interviewer, supervisor, etc) based on their skills and knowledge. Long term supervisors sometimes develop a sense of entitlement or superiority, don’t pay attention as much and as a result don’t know the material as much as interviewers. Sometimes they also don’t hold their position due to other factors. See more on sections FIELD WORKERS and SELECTION.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Ensure fieldworker capacity</strong>. The selection process filters out those that are not performing sufficiently well to work as fieldworkers. Fieldworkers are selected among those who are capable of doing their job. Being selected based on skills Fieldworkers are selected based on their capacity</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Increased attention during training</strong>. With test from the first day and knowing about the competitive, merit-based selection, trainees understand that it matters to pay attention, participate and learn material independently. Knowing their relative score also motivates low performers to increase their efforts. Overall higher attention and participation translate into higher learning outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tailored feedback/training</strong>. Test results reveal early areas of the content that are poorly understood. Reviewing and debriefing written test often also provides valuable insights on where misunderstandings stem from or why mistakes are made. Trainers can tailor the training and feedback to address the issues, improving the overall level of understanding.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Verification of design</strong>. Writing and debriefing test often reveals unidentified gaps in the questionnaire design, such as underdefined concepts or conflicting definitions, and checks if explanations in the manual are useful or not.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fieldworkers do better</strong>. As humans, we do better at work if know that it matters. The tests and selection helps to convey to fieldworkers that the survey really cares about them doing their job well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Builds a reserve of replacement fieldworkers</strong>. Trainees who did not get selected (but were good enough) can replace fieldworkers that drop out during fieldwork. Since they have undergone the full training, they can be brought up to speed relatively quickly with a refresher training, some practicing and strong supervision during the first few days.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>rationale:</p>
<ul>
<li>selection into roles based on skills, capacity, best fits, supervisors, monitors etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>extert controll over firms that do it differently</p>
<p>Often field worker selection is done by the implementing organisation that might follow their own procedures. Be cautious as the selection criteria and processes might not result in optimal outcomes. We recommend the following procedures.</p>
<p>However, the processes described here are highly recommended. Try to exert some control over the implementing agency and make it conditional.</p>

<p>if pre-determined supervisors data mmonitors or other roles, they have to attend, contribute to and demonstrate understanding of the material in order to take on supervisory roles.</p>
<p>Different fieldworker roles can be trained in parallel training sessions. These can start from day 1 if there is no overlap in questionnaires/tasks and if different profiles of trainees have been recruited for different roles, e.g. trained nurses to conduct anemia tests. If not, it is usually useful to start parallel sessions after a few days of general training once there is a clearer picture of trainees’ capabilities and personalities. E.g. measurers need ot eb good with kids and practice, good number rading skills, but do not need to understand all concepts in a long hh questionnaire. Allows to trainees that perfroma ccordingly in the training.</p>

<p>Conduct written tests on a regular basis throughout the training, i.e. daily or every other day during class room days. On days with in-field practicing it is often not feasible to conduct tests, and there tends to be less new theoretical material that can be tested.</p>
<div id="designing-tests" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="17.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.1</span> Designing tests<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#designing-tests" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Written tests should probe the understanding of the questionnaire content and manual covered in the training so far, including protocols, definitions, answer options, as well as for relevant general skills such as calculating a percentage or average or converting quantities in units. If possible, tailored tests to the topics that were discussed during the (previous) day, so that tests also probe if trainees paid attention. Repeat questions or topics from previous tests that a large share of trainees answered wrongly.</p>
<p>Write questions that are very clear, can be answered unambiguously and be easily marked.
Do not write test that mainly consist of multiple choice questions as they tend to be relatively easy to answer and are not good at testing the actual level of understanding. For example, questions asking if something is true/false can be answered correctly 50% of the time by randomly selecting an answer. Instead, use questions that force the trainee to actively come up with an answer or require a combination of answers to be selected to be correct. Avoid open-ended questions, unless you have enough resources to review and score them for all trainees.</p>
<p>Don’t make questions too obvious. Sprinkle irrelevant or misleading information into the questions and answer options. Add <code>Don’t have enough information</code>, <code>All of the above</code> or <code>None of the above</code> as answer options to make it harder. Make sure the wrong answer options you add are plausible or relate to something trainees might have heard elsewhere. Occasionally add only correct or wrong option.</p>
<p>Aim for tests that take 15-30 minutes to answer, so you get enough data points on the level of understanding while not taking up too much time of the training. This translates to around 10-15 difficult questions, some of them multi-response. If possible, try out the tests among trainees (or even with designers) before administering it. This helps to identify ambiguous test questions and often also reveals previously unidentified gaps in the questionnaire design, such as underdefined concepts or conflicting definitions.</p>
<p>Below examples illustrate possible ways of phrasing effective test questions. A first possibility is to describe a scenario that has been covered in the training or is explained in the part of the manual that should have been read already by trainees, followed by a question of the questionnaire, asking trainees to record or select the correct answer.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Q1. The household has a daughter Musa who is 7 months old. What do you record in question
<em>“A4. How old is Musa in completed years?”</em></p>
<p>1………………………………………………………………………….1<br />
0………………………………………………………………………….2<br />
0.7………………………………………………………………………..3<br />
0.58 (7/12 months)…………………………………………………………..4<br />
Nothing, leave empty and add a comment ………………………………………..5<br />
None of the above……………………………………………………………6</p>
</div>
<p>Another useful way to phrase test question is to write a list of statements that probe a definition or protocol from different angles and ask trainees which of the statements are true or false.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Q6. Select all statements that are correct according to our parcel definition.

<p>A similar method is to list items with different attributes and ask trainees to select all items that apply, for example all individuals who should be considered household members, all transactions that are sales of livestock products, etc.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Q46. Select all of the following persons who worked for a wage or salary according

</div>
<p>As in the examples above, it tends to be useful to add numbers, letters or names to the answer options that are visible to the trainees. This makes it easier to refer to different answer options during the debrief sessions, e.g. <em>“Why do we consider Sumini to have worked for a wage or salary?”</em>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.2</span> Conducting the test<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#conducting-the-test" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>There are several possible modal ties to conduct the written tests in the interviewer training:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test printed on paper</strong>. Works well if you have printing facilities in the training venue. Do not print tests prior to the training, so you can update them during the training to include points that have been in the focus on the (previous) day.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Projector and paper</strong>. Project questions on the big screen and read them out. Ask trainees to take an empty sheet of paper, write their name on top and to record each question number with the answer next to it. Make sure trainees have differently coloured pen for marking. This methods is very flexible and useful for spontaneous tests as it allows last minute updates to the questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Directly on CAPI</strong>. This works well if a CAPI software is used that allows questionnaires to be built and updated quick and easily, such as Survey Solutions. Write the test as a questionnaire in CAPI, assign it to trainees at the beginning of the test and ask them to complete one test on their tablet and send it back. Often you can copy questions from the actual questionnaire and modify them for the test. Answers are available instantly and can be marked using code (also directly inside the questionnaire). A very useful side effect of this approach is that trainees also get used to handling CAPI, such as receiving assignments/questionnaires and submitting interviews. You need solid internet connection for all trainees to sync.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Google forms or similar</strong>. Several tools exist online that can be used to quickly write tests, deploy them on the trainees’ devices and make the results immediately available. Most of them are online based and require good internet connectivity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To conduct the quiz, disperse trainees throughout the training venue, so that they cannot copy from one another nor talk. For tests conducted electronically, trainees only need their tablet and can do without a desk. Walk around and invigilate the class to make sure trainees do not copy from or help one another. Help those that have technical issues and provide clarifications (to the entire class) if there is any general doubt about the quiz.</p>
<p>Decide if trainees can refer to the manual or their notes during the test or not. Usually there is benefit in alling them to do so, as it reinforces the manual as a reference and probes if trainees can work out the correct answer with the tools they will have available during the field.</p>
<p>Give sufficient time to trainees to complete the test, even if they have to refer to the manual a few times. Those that take a bit more time are not necessarily worse interviewers. You can decide to set an exact time limit, or stop the test once most trainees have submitted their test and there is no more progress among those that have not.</p>
<p>Test can be held at different hours of the day, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Conducting it in the morning has the advantage that trainees are freshest and will have had a chance to revise in the evening if they were falling behind or absent. However, it is probably best to review the test shortly afterwards, before more material will be covered during the day. This can put pressure on marking the test.</p>
<p>Holding the test at the end of the day makes good use of the late afternoons that often tend to be unproductive. It also stops trainees from disappearing during the day as the test effectively also serves as an attendance call. Trainers have the opportunity to mark in the evening and give feedback the following morning, which is a good way to repeat the material of the previous day. Also, trainees who have completed the test can already leave the venue and do not have to wait for everyone to finish. A disdvantge of conducting the tests in the afternoons is that trainees do not get the chance to learn and practice the material at thier own pace in the evening.</p>
</div>
<div id="marking-tests" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="17.2.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.3</span> Marking tests<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#marking-tests" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>It is important to mark tests quickly, so timely feedback can be given to trainees.</p>
<p>For tests conducted on paper, a fast way to mark test is to collect completed test papers and redistribute them to other trainees during the feedback session. Give clear guidance on how to mark each question as you go through the test with the class, e.g. ask to put a tick or x in a different color on the left of the question number and to write the total number of ticks in the top left corner at the end. During the feedback sessions, ask for a show of hands of those who marked a questions as correct or wrong to get a feeling of how well a questions was understood. At the end, collect the test papers, cross check the marking and and record the score for each trainee.</p>
<p>For tests conducted on CAPI or any other electronic tool, you can export the data and write a short script to mark the test. The script should for each trainee calculate the score and for each question, give the percentage of correct answers, tabulate wrong answers and list the names of trainees who answer it wrong. Have (a draft of) the script ready, so you can have the feedback session shortly afterwards. In some tools you can specify the correct answers and do the marking directly in the tool. If using Survey Solutions, this can be done by creating variables and displaying the score in supervisor level questions or questions conditional on supervisor level questions.</p>
</div>
<div id="providing-feedback" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="17.2.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.2.4</span> Providing feedback<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#providing-feedback" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>For each test, hold a feedback session, ideally shortly after the test, but no later than the following morning. Do better than just going through the correct answers. Actively involve trainees who got questions wrong to learn where misunderstandings are coming from and to ensure that the corrections are understood at the end. Involve the rest of the class to correct and explain in their own words.</p>
<p>One way to achieve this is to project the test on the screen and work through it question by question. For each question, ask one of the trainees who answered it incorrectly to come to the front, read the question, and answer it in front of class, explaining their reasoning and cognitive steps. The class should not help the trainee. Once they have answered the test question, ask the class if the answer was correct or wrong, the reasons why and to provide feedback. Step in if the class response is incorrect. Make sure the trainee in front understands where the error was in their thinking.</p>
<p>Sometimes discussions arise if test questions were ambiguous or if trainees feel like they have been marked incorrectly. Do not let discussion get carried away. Intervene, repeat what is correct and why and move on. If there were any issues with the test question or the marking, exclude the question from the overall score, tell the class and end the discussion. Make sure to correct any issues in the manual or questionnaire if they were the reasons for the misunderstanding, as they would likely cause confusion again if they go unaddressed.</p>
<p>Keep an Excel sheet or other systematic record of the scores. For each test, record the total number of points possible, and the points achieved by each trainee. Do not use the average between individual test scores to calculate a total score and ranking across all tests to date, as tests tend to be of different length and difficulty. Instead, calculate the total score as the sum of points achieved over the sum of total points possible in all tests to date.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">17.3</span> Evaluating skills<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#evaluating-skills" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Understanding the questionnaire alone does not make a good field worker. Other skills are equally important and must be observed during the training to inform a good field worker selection. Examples are the ability to use a tablet and CAPI, friendliness, seriousness, thoroughness, motivation, intonation of voice, etc.</p>
<p>Observing those skills with all trainees and evaluating their qualification as fieldworkers during the training requires you to be systematic, produce comparable scores and make good use of all sessions. Doing it “just like that” without a systematic marking and non comprehensively is not fair and becomes quickly unfeasible to get a comprehensive picture if there are more than a few trainees. There is benefit in identifying as early as possible if trainees do not possess any of the key skills, so you can still address it in the training, e.g. by giving additional extra tablet/CAPI practice sessions for those not comfortable enough using the tablet or software.</p>
<p>Want to do skill matrix, i.e. know which trainee has what skills can be used together with written exams for field worker selection</p>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>find right people</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.3.1</span> Identify key skills<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#identify-key-skills" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>To produce a comparable and comprehensive ranking, identify a few key skills that matter most for the project and cannot easily be probed for in the written test. Examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any of the trained interviewing skills</li>
<li>CAPI and tablet use</li>
<li>Sound of voice, intonation, reading speed (especially for phone surveys)</li>
<li>Capacity to self-organize</li>
<li>Friendliness and likability</li>
<li>Determinism (especially if high unit non-response rate is expected)</li>
<li>Trustworthiness and reliability (especially if working alone without supervision)</li>
<li>Thoroughness</li>
<li>Team leading and organizing (if selecting supervisors from trainees)</li>
<li>Interaction with children and mothers (for anthropomorphic or student tests)</li>
</ul>
<p>Aim to get a rating for each of the selected key skills for each trainee during the training. Be realistic, prioritize and select only the skills that matter most, max 3 - 5, so you actually manage to score all trainees against them.</p>
<p>If there is limited capacity and time to score against several criteria, give trainees scores for overall skills. When scoring, evaluate against the key skills, and record any diimensions in which they are outliers, i.e. perform very well or bad.</p>

Prepare a detailed scoring system with descriptions of each score. Make sure trainers know it and refer to it during scoring. Table <a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#tab:scoringsystem">17.1</a> shows an example scoring system ranging from 1 to 5:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.3.3</span> Create a skill matrix<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#create-a-skill-matrix" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Create a table with trainees in rows and skills as columns. Each cell should contain how the respective trainee scores in the relevant cell. Color coding helps to quickly generate an overview and identify generally weak skills or under-performing trainees. A quick and easy way of doing this is in a Spreadsheet. See an example here.</p>
<p>There are different ways of filling the matrix:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Trainers can record scores in their notes and copy them into the final matrix. This is easiest to set up, but cumbersome, difficult to keep track of and reconcile if trainees have been scored more than once for a skill.</p></li>
<li><p>Print the empty skill matrix for trainers to record their scores. Copy the scores into the final matrix. Slightly better than above, but still cumbersome and difficult to reconcile.</p></li>
<li><p>Record scores in a Google Form that contains a question to select the trainee name, one optional question for each skill, and a text field for comments. Trainers fill the form on an ongoing basis, rating only skills they have observed and recording comments. Answers are automatically stored in the Google Sheet, including the name of the scoring person and date time. Answers in the skill matrix can be calculated to be the average or last rating.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, the skill matrix also contains the results for every test and the overall score, so you can get a quick overview of trainees performance.</p>
<p>If needed, you can calculate an average score across all skills for each trainee and also combine it with the test result to obtain a single score only, but be aware that the individual components might be quite different and best not be aggregated, or might have to be weighted differently. Always also rely on the individual components if referring to the aggregate.</p>

<div id="rate-skills" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="17.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.3.4</span> Rate skills<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#rate-skills" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>A fieldworker training only provides you with a short amount of time to do a comprehensive rating of trainees skills, so start as early as possible and rate in all phases of the training.</p>
<p>During the theory part of the training, engage as much as possible with trainees and score them against skills that you can rate based on the interaction, e.g. you can score their ability to read out questions or intonation of their voice easily during the questionnaire reading sessions. Some skills can also easily be observed during the classroom-based training by trainers not leading the class, e.g. the ability to use the CAPI software or tablets.</p>
<p>During practicing sessions, in class or in the field, assign to each trainer a set of trainees to be observed and scored. Trainers should observe a trainee long enough to get a good enough impression to be able to score them against one or more skills, and should then move on to another trainee.</p>
<p>Regularly check the skill matrix for completion, and target trainees that you have not evaluated yet. Rate If you can afford it, try that each trainee has been rated by more than one trainer to create a consensus decision.</p>
<p>Give feedback to trainees. If you scored them low on a skill, explain why and that they should try to improve it throughout the training.</p>
<p>Be aware of changes over time as trainees have (hopefully) acquired skills during the training. Scores from the beginning of the training for one trainee are not necessarily comparable to those for another at the end. Try that your scores are reflective as much as possible of the skill levels at the end of the training, as you are ultimately interested in trainees’ potential to perform in the field, not their learning curve throughout the training.</p>
<p>Reconfirm extreme scores, especially bad ones towards the end of the training, and scores for trainees that are not clearly in or outside of the selection that is merging towards the end.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.5.1</span> Timing<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#timing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Select field workers at the end of the training and prior to the start of field work. This could be before or after the final dress rehearsal and depends on the survey circumstances.</p>
<p>Selecting after the address allows for more time to observe trainees and for trainees to show their strength in the field. Trainees that will not be selected and act as a replacement reserve will have had some field experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, selecting prior to the dress rehearsal allows you to form the actual field teams already, so they can practice in their field composition and so that you can make adjustments if necessary.</p>
<p>AK NOTES: Some trainees might deselect themselves during the training by dropping out. Prior to the selection, only dismiss trainees where it is already clear that they have unacceptable skill levels or personality traits (e.g. unrealibility). be careful to not drop trainees that might improve. Many need more time, or start to improve once they realise their relative performance levels are low.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.5.2</span> Criteria<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#criteria" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The fieldworker selection should only be based on trainees’ overall test results, skill ratings and other objective characteristics relevant for the project. Do not select based on subjective criteria such as personal liking or criteria that are irrelevant such as having or not having a degree.</p>
<p>How you weigh individual criteria highly depends on the project and training outcome and has to be decided on a case by cases basis. Do not exclusively rely on the overall test scores by simply selecting the trainees with the best scores.</p>
<p>Do not overvalue or favor experience, as experienced interviewers are not necessarily better. If you select survey teams based on capacity, over time the best interviewers will be the most experienced ones. See Chapter RECRUITMENT for more information.</p>
<p>The selection should be comprehensible and justifiable using the applied criteria. For example, if one trainee has been selected over another one who performed better in the tests, there should be objective reasons, such as higher scores in relevant key skills. You can decide to make the selection and criteria public to the trainees after the selection.</p>
</div>
<div id="selection-process" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="17.5.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">17.5.3</span> Selection process<a href="assess-select-fieldworkers.html#selection-process" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The following selection algorithm tends to work well. You might have to adapt it a little to meet the requirements of your survey:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First, discarding trainees with unacceptable performance or skill levels. They should not be used as field workers unless they receive special training after the training to bring them to acceptable levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Select all special roles among those who score highest in the required special skills. For example, select data quality control officers among those who have well understood the material, are very reliable and thorough. Select supervisors among those who have good leadership and organizational skills, but do not necessarily need to be top of the class in the test results if they are not involved in the data monitoring (see chapter FIELD). Select anthropometrics specialists who did best in anthropometrics training.</p></li>
<li><p>Rank the remaining trainees based on test scores, skill ratings, and other criteria you might have and select from top. Often you might find that you have too few or too many trainees with adequate skill levels. Ideally you can adjust your field work model accordingly. If there are too few, only select those capable and use fewer or smaller teams for longer, or extend the training to bring them up to speed. If more trainees qualify than required, you can think of using larger or more teams for a shorter amount of time, but be aware that larger field teams are harder to monitor.</p></li>
<li><p>Allocate selected staff into teams, double check they balance well and adjust steps 2 and 3 if not. For team allocation, keep in mind any special requirements you might have, such as gender balance, languages, etc. Try to balance the skill levels within teams by mixing top and bottom of class, so stronger trainees can support and act as a reference for weaker trainees. Make sure teams know who should learn from whom, and that they should support one another. Also be aware of personal traits and group dynamics when allocating into teams.<br />
</p></li>
<li><p>Keep trainees with adequate skill levels who have not been selected as reserve to replace fieldworkers who drop out during field work. Inform them that they are on a waiting list and might be called should others leave.</p></li>
