[["introduction-to-training.html", "Introduction to Training", " Introduction to Training Fieldwork training is arguably one of the most important activities of any survey and has one of the most substantial impacts on data quality. It serves several purposes: Build fieldworker capability. In-depth content training, extensive practicing and capability-based selection ensure that fieldworkers are capable of implementing the survey as designed. This is key to limit measurement and nonresponse error, as well as coverage and sampling error if the survey includes listing and in-field sampling. Standardize fieldworker behavior. Repeated practicing under supervision and continuous feedback streamlines how fieldworkers implement the survey. Reducing idiosyncratic behavior is important to mitigate the very damaging fieldworker effects. Scrutinize methodology. Particularly in surveys with limited pre-testing and piloting, fieldwork training often effectively is the most detailed review of the questionnaires, translations, CAPI and survey processes. Identifying and correcting mistakes is key to reducing specification error. Unfortunately, in many surveys fieldwork training is not implemented effectively to produce fieldworkers that are fully capable of implementing the survey, or is inefficient in being too demanding on trainers, survey budget and timeline. This part of the book gives recommendations on how to implement fieldwork training that effectively prepares field workers while not overburdening trainers or overstretching survey resources. It assumes fieldwork training to be in-person, as is custom for most socio-economic surveys with personal interviews. Chapter 5 Planning and Preparation is targeted at survey designers, managers, fieldwork managers, trainers or any other role that is involved in the planning, budgeting and preparation of the fieldwork training. It provides recommendations on the training location, timing, size, the trainers, training content and schedules, and includes checklists of the key items to prepare prior to the training. Chapter 6 Conducting the training gives useful recommendations on how an effective and efficient fieldwork training can be conducted. It provides extensive details and step-by-step guides for different training modules. It is mainly targeted towards trainers and is best during training preparation and the training itself. Chapter 7 Assess &amp; select fieldworkers describes how to implement a competitive skill-based fieldworker selection that is critical to achieve quality in surveys. The chapter is mainly targeted towards trainers and gives step-by-step guides on how to effectively implement written tests, systematically evaluate skills and select fieldworkers. Survey designers and managers may be interested in reading about the benefits of this approach that are summarized at the beginning of the chapter. TL;DR. Follow below key recommendations to ensure a successful fieldworker training. Train an excess of at least 20% of fieldworkers to allow for a meaningful competency-based fieldworker selection at the end of the training and to have a reserve of fieldworkers. If working with unknown teams, mainly new recruits, or expected high attrition, increase the excess to 40% to ensure capable fieldworkers. Assess trainees from the beginning. Use frequent written tests throughout the training to evaluate their understanding of the survey content or standardization tests to assess their ability of taking expert measurements. Observe and rate key skills in a structured way. Select fieldworkers based on capacity. Select interviewers, supervisors and other fieldwork roles towards the end of the training, based on capacity demonstrated during the training. Be careful when considering other criteria such as previous survey experience, as they may reduce the capacity level of the field teams. Dont cut on duration! Allow for at least 15 working days of fieldwork training for a LSMS-style survey with a 2-2.5 hrs questionnaire. Anything shorter is normally not enough for the complex content of a socio-economic questionnaire to be learned and sufficiently practiced. Keep it small. Try not to train more than 50 people at the same time. Learning outcomes quickly decrease with larger class sizes. If necessary, try to adjust the fieldwork plan such that fewer fieldworkers work over a longer period. Sufficient and experienced trainers. Delivering good training is more than a full-time job. Make sure there are enough trainers and that they have solid survey, context and subject experience. Sending a junior colleague without much experience to be in charge of the training is not a good idea. Be prepared. Make sure questionnaires, translations, CAPI and manuals are truly ready prior to the start of the training and have been thoroughly tested. Have the venue fully set up and all admin and logistics sorted. The quality of the training can suffer badly from insufficient preparation. Less instructional &amp; theoretical, more interactive &amp; hands-on. Avoid one-directional training methods where trainers give long presentations about theory and questionnaires. Instead, engage trainees as much as possible. Train using the manual, demonstrations, videos, real-world examples, etc. Practice, practice, practice. Frequent practice is crucial for trainees to fully internalize the content and be able to apply in the field. Do not leave (field) practice to the end. Practice in groups, front-of-class interviews and with respondents on-site or in the field throughout the training. Go beyond the questionnaire. Knowing the questionnaires alone does not make good interviewers. Trainees need to learn and practice a set of interviewing techniques such as correct probing or encouraging participation as well as pre- or post-interview tasks, such as respondent selection or responding to rejected interview files. Assess readiness for field. At the end of the training, a final field test should be conducted that mimics field conditions and where fieldworkers can be observed and feedback given without using the actual sample. If the team is not ready extend the training by a few days to revisit and strengthen problematic areas. Engage. As a survey designer or manager, do not sit back and leave it to the survey firm, fieldwork manager or trainers alone to deliver the training. Actively participate, check that the content is correctly understood, explain what matters, etc. You have put a lot of effort into the design. Make sure it is implemented correctly. "]]
