abstract = {The Census Bureau developed guidelines for the translation of data collection instruments and supporting materials in order to ensure that such documents translated from a source language into a target language are reliable, complete, accurate, and culturally appropriate. In addition to meeting these criteria, guidelines were developed to ensure that translated Census Bureau data collection instruments also have semantic, conceptual, and normative equivalence. The guideline recommends that the translation of data collection instruments from a source language into a target language be conducted using a translation team. The guideline relies on the cross-cultural and survey methodology research literature and specifies and describes five steps that comprise the translation process. These steps are: Prepare, Translate, Pretest, Revise, and Document.},

abstract = {Purpose: To examine the influence of translation when measuring and comparing self-rated health (SRH) measured with five response categories (excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor), across racial/ethnic groups. Methods: Using data from the California Health Interview Survey, which were administered in five languages, we analyzed variations in the five-category SRH across five racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white, Latino, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean. Logistic regression was used to estimate independent effects of race/ethnicity, culture, and translation on SRH, after controlling for risk factors and other measures of health status. Results: Latinos, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Koreans were less likely than non-Hispanic whites to rate their health as excellent or very good and more likely to rate it as good, fair, or poor. This racial/ethnic difference diminished when adjusting for acculturation. Independently of race/ethnicity, respondents using non-English surveys were less likely to answer excellent (OR = 0.24-0.55) and very good (OR = 0.30-0.34) and were more likely to answer fair (OR = 2.48-4.10) or poor (OR = 2.87-3.51), even after controlling for other measures of SRH. Conclusions: Responses to the five-category SRH question depend on interview language. When responding in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese, respondents are more likely to choose a lower level SRH category, "fair" in particular. If each SRH category measured in different languages is treated as equivalent, racial/ethnic disparities in SRH among Latinos and Asian subgroups, as compared to non-Hispanic whites, may be exaggerated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Computer audio-recorded interviewing (CARI) has been used for more than a decade to detect field-interview fabrication, but it has the potential for much more. On the 2007 National Home and Hospice Care Survey, an innovative CARI system combined with behavior coding assessed problematic questions, monitored general compliance with protocols, and evaluated individual interviewer performance. This article discusses the benefits of CARI for recording large samples of interviews in a systematic, objective manner at reduced cost and less operational burden than traditional audio recording. The increased objectivity and volume of recordings allowed identification of potential data-quality issues, specifically measurement error due to the questionnaire, the interviewer, and their interaction. CARI's potential as a tool for estimating the magnitude of the error in survey data is also discussed. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.},
