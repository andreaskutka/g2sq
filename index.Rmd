## About this book{-}

What is survey quality and how can it be achieved? This book gives practical advice 

experiences and practices that have worked in. 

based upon our experience in designing and implementing large scale socio-economic surveys in a variety of contexts. 


recognises the multi-dimensionality of survey quality and follows the total survey error paradigm

total survey quality optimization

the practical tips and techniques that ...

The book is targeted towards a range of survey practitioner roles. Survey designers, sponsors will find guidance on design decisions that are relevant for quality in chapters X and Y. They might also benefit from reading the introduction chapters to the following chapters. Survey implementer will find tips & tricks and best practices in chapters Z and ZZ to maximize quality for all main steps of survey implementation. Individual sections provide details for individual key roles, including trainers, translators, etc. 

The book provides detailed steps and best practices for all survey phases. Survey practitioners are not encouraged to implement everything, as this would be beyond most surveys' budget and time constraints, and as there might be alternative methods with equally good outcomes. Survey practitioners can use the detailed information for those components that form part of their quality assurance plan, or use the detail to reflect on or improve own practices. 

The book is a companion and go-to reference for survey practitioners aiming to improve the quality of the surveys they design and implement. The book follows the survey life cycle, and explaining the best practices and providing tips and tricks on how to achieve high quality surveys. 

The book is very comprehensive on each of the survey phases. Readers are not expected to implement all how-to-guidelines listed in the book. Instead, the book is meant to be a collection best practices to achive high quality in surveys. Survey practitioners are encouraged to evaluate which improvements can be implemented within the context and constraints of their respective survey.


Follows the total survey quality framework, and touches base on the survey design, implementation and analysis. 

The book is written as companion for survey managers to help them take the right decisions, organize their team and works streams and how to obtain the right types of inputs in every phase of the survey to achieve high quality outputs. While providing a lot of detail in some parts, the book does not aim to be a comprehensive how-to-survey guide. Further guidelines and the input of experts are needed to achieve high quality surveys. 

The recommendations described in the book should not be interpreted as being the one and only way of implementing surveys. For many parts, there may be alternative approaches that deliver results of similar quality. However, the methodology presented in this book has proven to be effective in delivering quality surveys while being efficient, huzzle-free and without bad surprises. The authors welcome comments that point them towards other approaches. 

The book is divided into 6 parts. Part I provides a short introduction of key concepts of survey quality. It is the only theoretical part of the book. Parts II - IV follow the different stages of a survey life cycle from inception, design, preparation, training, fieldwork to post-field. Each part is comprised of several chapters. The first chapter to each part is an introduction that outlines the content of the remaining chapters and provides a "cheatsheet" version of our key recommendations, called [TL;DR](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TL%3BDR).

References for each chapter are added to the bottom. In the Appendix, you can find the list of Abbreviations and Acronyms, as well as a complete list of all references used throughout the book.

The book is a living document that is being expanded and revised on an ongoing basis. Whenever we become aware of new best practices, we will try to integrate them into the book. The last update was made on `r format(Sys.Date(),"%d %B %Y")`. 

Book is often written with reference to a LSMS-style household surveys implemented in cAPI (Survey Solutions) as most surveys are now. However, almost everything in the book applies generally to most survey types or other software packages. 

## How to use this book{-}

The book provides a lot of information and details that are probably difficult to absorb entirely and retain for the duration of the survey. 

* For those who are managing one of their first surveys we recommend skim reading the document focusing on the introductions to each chapter and skipping the details. They summarize the key points and provide you with a general idea of what matters to achieve survey quality. Once the survey is underway, reading the relevant chapters prior to thinking about a phase will give you all the details you need at this point.  

* Experienced survey managers who are curious about or aiming to improve certain aspects can read the relevant chapters only. 

* The book is relatively extensive and contains a lot of detail. It is not written to be read in one go (we applaud your stamina if you do), but rather as go-to reference that can be visited during any stage of the survey to get relevant practical advice and learn about best practices.

* Chapters are written to be as independent as possible of each other. This causes some points to be repeated in another chapter.  Links to other chapters are added to where relevant information is  References are provided if they built upon other parts of the book or if more detail is provided elsewhere. 

* Use the search function to quickly find all occurrences of a word or phrase. Open the search function by clicking on the search icon on top or by typing `f` on your keyboard. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate between different search matches.

## About The LSMS Guideline series{-}

The LSMS Guidebook series offers information on best practices related to survey design and implementation. While the Guidebooks differ in scope, length, and style, they share a common objective: to provide statistical agencies, researchers, and practitioners with rigorous yet practical guidance on a range of issues related to designing and fielding high-quality household surveys. The series draws on experience accumulated from decades of LSMS survey implementation, the expertise of LSMS staff and other survey experts, and new research using LSMS data and methodological validation studies.
