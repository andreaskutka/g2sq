## About this book{-}

The book is a companion and go-to reference for survey practitioners aiming to improve the quality of the surveys they design and implement. The book follows the survey life cycle, and explaining the best practices and providing tips and tricks on how to achieve high quality surveys. 

Follows the total survey quality framework, and touches base on the survey design, implementation and analysis. 

The book is written as companion for survey managers to help them take the right decisions, organize their team and works streams and how to obtain the right types of inputs in every phase of the survey to achieve high quality outputs. While providing a lot of detail in some parts, the book does not aim to be a comprehensive how-to-survey guide. Further guidelines and the input of experts are needed to achieve high quality surveys. 

The book is a living document that is being expanded and updated on an ongoing basis.

The book is divided into 6 parts that follow the different stages of a survey life cycle from inception to data archiving. The introduction chapter to each part provides a quick overview of the content and a "cheatsheet" version of the key recommendations.

## How to use this book{-}

The book provides a lot of information and details that are probably difficult to absorb entirely and retain for the duration of the survey. 

* For those who are managing one of their first surveys we recommend skim reading the document focusing on the introductions to each chapter and skipping the details. They summarize the key points and provide you with a general idea of what matters to achieve survey quality. Once the survey is underway, reading the relevant chapters prior to thinking about a phase will give you all the details you need at this point.  

* Experienced survey managers who are curious about or aiming to improve certain aspects can read the relevant chapters only. Chapters are written to be independent of each other. References are provided if they built upon other parts of the book or if more detail is provided elsewhere.

* Use the search function to quickly find all occurrences of a word or phrase. Open the search function by clicking on the search icon on top or by typing `f` on your keyboard. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate between different search matches.

* You can download a printable pdf document of the current version of the book. For previous versions, check on github.

* You can download a EPUB file to read the book on your Ereader. EPUB files can  be converted online to the MOBI format that is compatible with Amazon Kindle readers. 

* From correcting typos to modifying chapters, if you have any suggestions on how to improve the book, you can edit the book by clicking on the edit icon on top. This will open the underlying file on github where you can make the modifications and submit them as a pull request (You will need an account). The book is written using Rmarkdown in [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook).

## About The LSMS Guideline series{-}

The LSMS Guidebook series offers information on best practices related to survey design and implementation. While the Guidebooks differ in scope, length, and style, they share a common objective: to provide statistical agencies, researchers, and practitioners with rigorous yet practical guidance on a range of issues related to designing and fielding high-quality household surveys. The series draws on experience accumulated from decades of LSMS survey implementation, the expertise of LSMS staff and other survey experts, and new research using LSMS data and methodological validation studies.
