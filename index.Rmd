## About this book{-}

The book is a companion and go-to reference for survey practitioners aiming to improve the quality of  the surveys they design and run. The book follows the survey life cycle, and explaining the best practices and providing tips and tricks on how to achieve high quality surveys. 

The book is written as companion for survey managers to help them take the right decisions, organize their team and works streams and how to obtain the right types of inputs in every phase of the survey to achieve high quality outputs. While providing a lot of detail in some parts, the book does not aim to be a comprehensive how-to-survey guide. Further guidelines and the input of experts are needed to achieve high quality surveys. 

The book is a living document that is being expanded and updated on an ongoing basis.


## How to use this book{-}

The book provides a lot of information and details that are probably difficult to absorb entirely and retain for the duration of the survey. 

* For those who are managing one of their first surveys we recommend skim reading the document focusing on the introductions to each chapter and skipping the details. They summarize the key points and provide you with a general idea of what matters to achieve survey quality. Once the survey is underway, reading the relevant chapters prior to thinking about a phase will give you all the details you need at this point.  

* Experienced survey managers who are curious about or aiming to improve certain aspects can read the relevant chapters only. Chapters are written to be independent of each other. References are provided if they built upon other parts of the book or if more detail is provided elsewhere.

* Use the search function to quickly find all occurrences of a word or phrase. Open the search function by clicking on the search icon on top or by typing `f` on your keyboard. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate between different search matches.
